We need translators!

# Progress
Text blocks: 8 / 17002

Cinematics: 0 / 17


**09 March 2021**

The idea of this project is to start translating the game from japanse to english and then from english to spanish. We have all the tools and processes ready for this.
I dont know japanase lol so I am going to watch some of the english walkthroughs on youtube for the game and "translate" at least the first 30 minutes to show you!

Texture translations and improvements
https://gbatemp.net/threads/suikoden-hd-texture-translation.582196/

Intructions for 1vierock's patch:
1. Install PPSSPP
2. Load up your rom
3. Go to Game Settings > Tools > Developer Tools
4. Check "Replace textures"
5. Inside your PPSSPP folder, there will be a folder somewhere called PSP (mine is in PPSSPP/memstick/PSP)
6. You should see a folder called TEXTURES. If not, make it and go in
7. Create a folder called NPJH50535 (that's the ID of the game)
8. Copy the contents of the download above into that folder
9. Check PSP/TEXTURES/NPJH50535/textures.ini exists
